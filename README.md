# SubXPAT

SubXPAT is a fully automated framework for approximate logic synthesis (ALS) based on the XPAT algorithm. It targets circuits described in Verilog and its core idea is to perform circuit rewriting in a way that is both local, i.e., is applied piece-wise to selected subcircuits, and extensive, i.e., systematically explores the design space for good solutions.

For details on the XPAT algorithm, please see our [DSN-W'23] paper.


## Dependencies

SubXPAT has been developed for a **Linux** environment and requires the manual installation of the following dependencies:

- [Python] (version 3.8 or higher)
- [Yosys] (using apt: `sudo apt install yosys`)
- [GraphViz] (you also need the headers for development, using apt: `sudo apt install graphviz graphviz-dev`)
- [OpenSTA] (using apt: `sudo apt install opensta`)

**Note:** the binaries of Yosys and OpenSTA should be added to your PATH.

### Optional

- Cell libraries (by default our cell library is `TODO`, this can be replaced by having the following dependencies and by using the `--cell-library` argument):
  - [SI2 `FreePDK45nm`][FreePDK45nm]


## Setup

To prepare the system for execution you will need to follow a few steps:

1. Initial system setup:
    ```bash
    # bulk commands
    make setup     # everything

    # individual commands
    make py_init     # create python environment
    make py_dep      # install/update requirements
    make local_dep   # create input folders and local files
    ```

2. Activate the python environment:
    ```bash
    . .venv/bin/activate
    ```


### Other useful commands

- To remove temporary files and the virtual python environment:
    ```bash
    # all together
    make clean

    # individually
    make rm_cache # remove the pycache folders
    make rm_temp  # remove temporary files
    make rm_pyenv # remove the virtual python environment
    ```

- To display the program help:
    ```bash
    make help
    ```


## Usage

SubXPAT is used by running the following command:
```bash
python3 main.py exact-benchmark [options]
```

Here are all the parameters with their arguments and descriptions:

### Examples

To execute the framework with the XPAT algorithm in the standard configuration, run the following command:
```bash
python3 main.py adder_i8_o5 --max-lpp=8 --max-ppo=32 --max-error=16
```

To execute the framework with SubXPAT iterations, bit-vector logic encoding, and the defaults, run the following command:
```bash
python3 main.py adder_i8_o5 --subxpat --encoding=z3bvec --max-lpp=8 --max-ppo=10 --imax=6 --omax=3 --max-error=16
```

To execute the framework with SubXPAT iterations, integer logic encoding, subgraph extraction mode 5 (all sub-outputs weight must be less than the error threshold), maximum labeling, ..., run the following command:
```bash
python3 main.py adder_i8_o5 --subxpat --encoding=z3int --extraction-mode=5 --max-labeling --max-lpp=8 --max-ppo=10 --max-error=16 --imax=2 --omax=8
```


Once a command is finished executing, you can find the outputs in the following directories:

`output/csv/` contains the log of execution and all information for each iteration.
`output/ver/` contains the Verilog descriptions of all the approximate circuits found.
`output/gv/` contains the information of all the subgraphs that have been selected, in a visual form.


## Known limitations

- On Apple devices running M# architecture, you will have problems with some packages. \
  No support is given at the moment for this situation.
