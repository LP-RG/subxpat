# 131

### features:
  - added new way of computing max labeling through the use of cqesto

### code:
  - the code in: `QBF_labeling.py` can be used in a similar way of that in `labeling.py`, you need to pass the exact graph, the approximate graph, the error threshold of the current iteration (used to determine which gate needs to be labeled) and you can also pass a dictionary with labels of specific gates already set to a specific value, useful it the label for those gates is already known
